## Notes
A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.
The render method returns a __description__ of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result.

### BABEL
Transforms modern javascript to something that can run on all browsers.
Depends on plugins to do it.
In react for instance, it provides support for the JSX syntax

### Developer Tools
The React Devtools extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/) lets you inspect a React component tree with your browser’s developer tools.
